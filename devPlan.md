# AI-Assisted Console Program Developer Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to create an AI-assisted console program that acts as an intermediary between users and command-line applications. The main goal is to allow users to interact with various console programs using natural language, without needing to know specific command syntax.

### Key Concepts

1. **Natural Language Interface**: Users can input commands in plain language, making complex operations more accessible.

2. **Universal Compatibility**: The program should work with any command-line application, not just predefined ones like git or ffmpeg.

3. **Context-Aware Processing**: The AI assistant should understand the current state of the system and the target application to provide accurate responses.

4. **Safe Execution**: All commands should be validated and executed safely to prevent unintended consequences.

5. **Learning and Adaptation**: The system should be capable of learning from user interactions and improving over time.

### Functionality Overview

1. **Command Interpretation**:
   - Parse user input to understand the intended action.
   - Identify the target program (e.g., git, ffmpeg) from the input or context.

2. **Environment Analysis**:
   - Detect the version and capabilities of the target program.
   - Analyze the current system state relevant to the user's request.

3. **Action Planning**:
   - Generate a step-by-step plan to achieve the user's goal.
   - Translate natural language intent into specific console commands.

4. **User Confirmation**:
   - Present the generated plan to the user in an understandable format.
   - Allow the user to confirm or reject the plan before execution.

5. **Execution and Feedback**:
   - Execute the confirmed plan, running commands sequentially.
   - Provide real-time feedback and results to the user.

6. **Error Handling and Clarification**:
   - Detect and handle errors during execution.
   - Ask for clarification if the user's intent is unclear.

7. **Session Management**:
   - Maintain context across multiple interactions within a session.
   - Allow for interruption and resumption of complex tasks.

### Technical Architecture

1. **Core Components**:
   - CLI Interface: Handles user input and output.
   - NLU Engine: Processes natural language using OpenAI's GPT models.
   - Command Executor: Safely runs console commands and captures output.
   - Session Manager: Maintains state and context between interactions.

2. **Integration Points**:
   - OpenAI API: For natural language processing and command generation.
   - System Shell: For executing commands and gathering system information.

3. **Key Technologies**:
   - Bun: JavaScript runtime for fast execution and built-in tooling.
   - LlamaIndex or similar: For structured interaction with the OpenAI API.

4. **Security Considerations**:
   - Input sanitization to prevent command injection.
   - Whitelisting of allowed commands and operations.
   - User permission checks for sensitive operations.

### User Interaction Flow

1. User inputs a natural language command.
2. The system analyzes the input and current environment.
3. AI generates a plan of action.
4. The plan is presented to the user for confirmation.
5. Upon confirmation, commands are executed sequentially.
6. Results are displayed to the user.
7. The system asks for further instructions or ends the session.

### Development Principles

1. **Modularity**: Design components that can be easily extended or replaced.
2. **Safety First**: Prioritize safe execution and user data protection.
3. **User-Centric Design**: Focus on creating an intuitive and helpful user experience.
4. **Extensibility**: Build with future enhancements and community contributions in mind.
5. **Thorough Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing at all levels of the application.

With this overview in mind, the following development plan outlines the steps to bring this AI-assisted console program to life:


Here's a step-by-step plan for the developer to implement the AI-assisted console program, starting from scratch:

1. Project Setup
   - Initialize a new Bun project
   - Set up version control (e.g., Git)
   - Create a basic project structure (src folder, main file)

2. CLI Interface
   - Implement basic command-line argument parsing
   - Handle piped input and direct command input

3. OpenAI API Integration
   - Install and configure llamaindex or similar library
   - Set up environment variables for API keys
   - Create a basic function to send requests to the OpenAI API

4. Context Gathering Module
   - Implement functions to detect target program and version
   - Create safe execution wrappers for running shell commands
   - Develop functions to analyze current environment (e.g., git status)

5. Natural Language Understanding and Plan Generation
   - Design prompts for the AI to understand user intent
   - Implement logic to generate structured plans from AI responses
   - Create a function to format plans for user presentation

6. User Interaction Loop
   - Develop functions to present plans to the user
   - Implement user confirmation handling (Y/N input)

7. Command Execution Module
   - Create a safe execution environment for running planned commands
   - Implement step-by-step execution with output capturing
   - Develop error handling and execution flow control

8. Session Management
   - Design and implement session storage mechanism
   - Create functions to save and load session state
   - Implement logic for handling interrupted sessions

9. Error Handling and Clarification System
   - Develop logic for detecting unclear user intents
   - Implement AI-driven clarification questions
   - Create a system for handling and presenting errors to users

10. Security Measures
    - Implement command validation and sanitization
    - Create a whitelist system for allowed commands
    - Develop user permission checks

11. Testing and Refinement
    - Write unit tests for core functions
    - Perform integration testing with various target programs
    - Conduct user testing and gather feedback

12. Documentation and Polishing
    - Write user documentation and usage instructions
    - Create developer documentation for future contributions
    - Refine code structure and add comments

13. Extensibility Features
    - Design a plugin system for adding new target program support
    - Implement configuration options for users

14. Final Testing and Release Preparation
    - Conduct thorough testing across different environments
    - Prepare for initial release (e.g., packaging, distribution method)
