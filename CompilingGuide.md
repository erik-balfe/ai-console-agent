 Yes, you can create a standalone executable program using Bun that can be run directly from the shell, without requiring users to install Bun first. This is possible using Bun's `--compile` flag for generating a standalone binary from a TypeScript or JavaScript file [(1)](https://bun.sh/docs/bundler/executables#worker) .

Here's how you can create such a program:

1. First, write your program in TypeScript or JavaScript. For example:

```typescript
console.log("Hello world!");
```
2. Then, use the `bun build` command with the `--compile` flag to generate a standalone binary:

```bash
bun build ./cli.ts --compile --outfile mycli
```
This will bundle your `cli.ts` file into an executable that can be executed directly:

```bash
$ ./mycli
Hello world!
```
The resulting executable includes all imported files and packages, along with a copy of the Bun runtime. It supports all built-in Bun and Node.js APIs.

To handle command-line arguments like `--help`, you can use `Bun.argv` to access the argument vector [(2)](https://bun.sh/guides/process/argv) . For more advanced argument parsing, you can use the `util.parseArgs` function.

This approach allows you to distribute your program as a standalone shell program that users can run without needing to install Bun first.
