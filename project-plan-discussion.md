# Owner:

Id like to create an app that will help people to use console based apps easily without knowing their commands and reading help note. 
I want it to add as less steps for users as possible. Ideally something like "git | ai remove .tmp file from the repo but keep it in system and on disk. I need it but do not want it to be added to git."

So user can give direct order (or promp, or question) to the target program (git in this case) and my app (in this example it is just "ai" named app will detect somehow the target app and read help, man and anything else available on the computer to get all the information about version of the app. Then it will detect current state (like running "git status", "git log" etc (not changing current state) and then it will somehow solve the user problem. 
Maybe by providing one line command that will make all the actions that are needed to complete it. Maybe by running the carefully selected sequence of commands to make the result.
Maybe the tactics of the solving the problem must be printed in the console and final confirmation must be asked frmo the user (like y or n). 
I want you to help me with implementing such program. 
First, lets discuss whether it can be implemented and can work as i desire at all. 
Also i want to understand whether there are ways to implement such super easy short and flexible ux. Like pipe with my program name and question.
Also I want your criticism about the idea, pros and cons of best possible implementation.


# system architect

**Introduction**

Creating an application that bridges the gap between natural language and console-based applications is an innovative idea that can significantly enhance user experience and accessibility. The concept involves users issuing commands in plain English (or any natural language), and your application interprets these commands, translates them into appropriate console commands, and executes them. This approach simplifies complex tasks and reduces the learning curve associated with command-line interfaces.

**Feasibility**

1. **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Advancements**: With the rapid development of NLP technologies, especially transformer-based models like GPT-4, it's feasible to interpret and process natural language instructions accurately.

2. **Command Mapping**: For well-documented applications like Git, mapping user intents to specific commands is achievable. Git has a comprehensive set of commands and flags that can be programmatically accessed and utilized.

3. **Environment Assessment**: Determining the current state of the system (e.g., running `git status`) can be automated. This allows the application to make informed decisions based on the current context without altering the state.

4. **Implementation Complexity**: While challenging, the implementation is within reach given the available technologies. It would require a combination of programming, NLP, and system integration skills.

**Possible Implementation Approaches**

1. **Standalone CLI Assistant**

   - **Description**: Develop a command-line tool (e.g., `ai`) that acts as an intermediary between the user and the target application.
   - **Usage**: The user pipes the target application into `ai` along with their natural language command.
     ```bash
     git | ai "remove .tmp file from the repo but keep it on disk"
     ```
   - **Functionality**:
     - Parse the natural language input.
     - Determine the user's intent.
     - Map the intent to one or more Git commands.
     - Execute the commands or present them to the user for confirmation.

2. **Shell Alias/Function**

   - **Description**: Create a shell alias or function that simplifies the command usage.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     ai git "remove .tmp file from the repo but keep it on disk"
     ```
   - **Functionality**:
     - The alias directly invokes the `ai` application with the target command and user input.
     - Easier to use and avoids the need for piping.

3. **Interactive Mode**

   - **Description**: Implement an interactive mode where the user starts the `ai` application and interacts with it in a conversational manner.
   - **Usage**:
     ```bash
     ai git
     ```
     Then, within the `ai` interface:
     ```
     > remove .tmp file from the repo but keep it on disk
     ```
   - **Functionality**:
     - Maintains context between commands.
     - Can handle complex multi-step operations.

**User Interface (UX) Considerations**

- **Natural Language Input**: Allow users to input commands in natural language without strict syntax requirements.
- **Minimal Steps**: Design the workflow to minimize the number of steps or commands the user needs to execute.
- **Feedback and Confirmation**:
  - Provide a summary of the actions to be taken.
  - Ask for user confirmation before executing potentially destructive commands.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle misunderstandings or ambiguities in the user's input by asking clarifying questions.
- **Extensibility**: Allow the application to support multiple console-based applications beyond Git.

**Pros of the Idea**

1. **Accessibility**: Lowers the entry barrier for beginners unfamiliar with complex command-line syntax.
2. **Efficiency**: Saves time for experienced users by reducing the need to recall specific command flags or syntax.
3. **Learning Aid**: Serves as an educational tool by showing the mapping between natural language and console commands.
4. **Automation**: Streamlines repetitive or multi-step tasks into single commands.

**Cons and Criticisms**

1. **Complexity of Natural Language Understanding**: Accurately interpreting user intent can be challenging due to the nuances and ambiguities of natural language.
2. **Error Propagation**: Misinterpretation of commands can lead to unintended actions, potentially causing data loss or other issues.
3. **Security Risks**:
   - Executing commands based on user input can introduce vulnerabilities.
   - Need to safeguard against injection attacks or malicious inputs.
4. **Performance Overhead**: Adding an interpretation layer may introduce delays compared to direct command execution.
5. **Dependency on External Models**: Relying on AI models for NLP may require internet access (if using cloud-based models) and introduce external dependencies.

**Implementation Challenges and Solutions**

- **Ambiguity Resolution**:
  - **Challenge**: User commands may be vague or ambiguous.
  - **Solution**: Implement a dialog system that asks clarifying questions to ensure understanding.
  
- **Context Awareness**:
  - **Challenge**: The application needs to understand the current state of the repository or environment.
  - **Solution**: Run non-invasive commands (like `git status`) to gather context without altering the state.
  
- **Security Measures**:
  - **Challenge**: Preventing execution of harmful commands.
  - **Solution**:
    - Implement a whitelist of allowed commands and flags.
    - Require explicit user confirmation before executing actions.
    - Run commands in a sandboxed environment when possible.

- **Model Updates and Maintenance**:
  - **Challenge**: Keeping the NLP model and command mappings up to date with application changes.
  - **Solution**:
    - Use modular code to separate the NLP logic from command mappings.
    - Regularly update mappings with new commands or deprecations.
    - Consider user contributions for continuous improvement.

**Best Practices for Implementation**

1. **Leverage Existing Tools**:
   - Utilize established NLP libraries (e.g., spaCy, NLTK) or AI models (e.g., GPT-based models) to handle language understanding.
   - Use parsing tools to read and interpret man pages or help documentation.

2. **Modular Design**:
   - Separate the language processing, command mapping, and execution modules.
   - Allows for easier updates and maintenance.

3. **User Privacy and Data Handling**:
   - Ensure that any data processed is handled securely.
   - Be transparent about any data sent to external services if cloud-based NLP models are used.

4. **Extensive Testing**:
   - Test the application with a wide range of inputs to handle edge cases.
   - Include unit tests and integration tests to ensure reliability.

5. **Community Involvement**:
   - Open the project to community contributions.
   - Encourage users to report issues, suggest features, and contribute code.

**Alternative Approaches**

- **Command Suggestion Tools**: Instead of executing commands, the application could suggest command snippets based on user input.
- **Interactive Tutorials**: Integrate with educational tools to teach users the underlying commands.
- **GUI Applications**: Develop a graphical interface that allows users to perform actions with buttons and menus, potentially lowering the need for natural language interpretation.

**Conclusion**

Implementing an AI-driven assistant for console-based applications is both feasible and potentially transformative for user interaction with command-line tools. It can democratize access to powerful tools like Git by making them more approachable. However, it requires careful consideration of the challenges involved, especially regarding reliability and security.

By starting with a specific application like Git, you can focus on creating a robust solution that can later be extended to other tools. Incorporating user feedback, adhering to best practices, and remaining vigilant about potential pitfalls will be key to the success of your application.

**Next Steps**

- **Prototype Development**: Begin by developing a simple prototype that handles a limited set of commands.
- **User Testing**: Gather a group of users to test the prototype and provide feedback.
- **Iterative Improvement**: Refine the application based on feedback and expand its capabilities gradually.
- **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for both users and contributors.
- **Open Source Consideration**: Consider making the project open source to benefit from community support and accelerate development.

**Final Thoughts**

Your idea holds significant promise in improving user experience with console applications. By thoughtfully addressing the challenges and leveraging modern technologies, you can create a tool that not only simplifies complex tasks but also empowers users to engage more deeply with the tools at their disposal.

Im going to use only LLMs via http like ChatGPT or local ollama or anyithing else if configured by user. But by default I will use only OpenAI API for simplicity at least for initial MVP version.

Also i want it to work with any programs, not only git.
So want not hardcode anything like "status" command. 
But id like to make it work with git at first place and some other commonly used programs that do not have any UI. Can you write a list of top 10 programs that do not have ui and users ask about them in forums because of that?
I want to test my MVP with some of them. Like maybe ffmpeg to cut a video or audio. I mean some simple and commonly used commands that users need to install different programs on thir computers or ever using nice web services that make the same things using the same ffmpeg. 

I want to implement all the stuff by just instructing AI to behave like i say.
So i want to code only the general strategy like this:
```
- understand user question. Describe how you understand it in context of the command he provided.
- explore current program version, describe its features and whether it is suitable for the user question. 
- Realize all needed information for executing of the user request.
- Get all the information needed. Execute any commands on the user host as super small and atomic commands not changing any state there. Your task here is only gain required information considering the user question.

- If information is enough and user intention is clear enough, write a plan of completion of the task. Describe it as a list of steps, each step must contain "command" field for exact command run on the user host, "description" field for description of the command and expected result. 
- provide user with a version of the plan describing it on user understandable language. 
```

Then, when user reads the plan, he can press Y or N.
If it's Y:
```
- execute all the commands in the plan. On each command that you pass to thu user host shell you will get text response with the output.
```

Also I plan to integrate something to catch the case where user request is not clear or even unrelated to the program or some mess. So in that case I think we can allow the agent to return a question to the user for clarification.

So the program will end in such case. But all the messages (agent thoughts) must be saved somewhere (in program folder) or in some temp folder for some short period of time just to be able to continue from where user left. So user can ask something like "git | ai merge current branch with feature/extensions branch" and no git repo in current folder found. So agent will return something like "Your not in a git repo. please run this command from git repo" and this message will be saved in the folder as a chat history. Then user makes cd to the folder with repo, runs the same command agent must be able to restore the session and continue from where it was left. (idk how we can implement this not to mix different "sessions" of using the program) Maybe we can put the featuer off and concentrate on making everything in one session for MVP?

I want to write the program on bun shell as i know JS very well and bun is super modern js runtime that recently intoduced their tool for writing shell scripts. So i hope i will be able to integrate my program written on js with shell. 

Alse i want to use library like llamaindex for making requests to OpenAI API. As tool calling is implemented in the library as well as agent class that has retrieval and some other stuff. I do not want to use retrieval but just to be able to add some more stuff. 

So can we more forward to implementing the program? Lets move step by step from designing the top level design lower to more specific things untill we write the program code. 



## system architect

**Great! Let's proceed step by step to design and implement your program. We'll start by outlining the top-level design and then delve into each component in more detail.**

---

### **1. Top-Level Design Overview**

Your program aims to act as an AI assistant that interfaces with any console-based application, allowing users to input natural language commands and have the assistant execute the appropriate console commands.

**Main Components:**

1. **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** The entry point where the user interacts with the program.

2. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** Utilizing an LLM (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-4 via API) to parse and understand the user's input.

3. **Context Gathering:**
   - **Program Detection:** Identify the target program (e.g., `git`, `ffmpeg`).
   - **Environment Analysis:** Collect necessary information (e.g., program version, current directory status) without altering the system state.

4. **Command Planning:**
   - **Intent Mapping:** Map the user's request to specific commands of the target program.
   - **Plan Generation:** Create a step-by-step plan with commands and descriptions.

5. **User Interaction Loop:**
   - **Plan Presentation:** Present the plan to the user in an understandable format.
   - **Confirmation Handling:** Process user confirmation (Y/N) to proceed or halt.

6. **Command Execution:**
   - **Safe Execution:** Run the commands, capturing output and errors.
   - **Output Handling:** Present results to the user.

7. **Session Management:**
   - **State Preservation:** Store session data to allow continuation if the program needs more information or the user needs to perform an action (e.g., change directories).

8. **Error Handling and Clarification:**
   - **Misunderstanding Resolution:** Ask clarifying questions if the user's intent is unclear.
   - **Error Messages:** Provide informative errors if issues occur.

---

### **2. Identifying Target Console Applications**

To ensure your MVP addresses common needs, here are the top 10 command-line programs that often lack a GUI and users frequently seek help with:

1. **Git**: Version control system.
2. **FFmpeg**: Audio and video processing.
3. **Curl/Wget**: Downloading files over HTTP/FTP.
4. **Tar/Gzip**: Archiving and compressing files.
5. **SSH**: Secure shell for remote connections.
6. **rsync**: File synchronization.
7. **grep**: Searching text using patterns.
8. **sed/awk**: Stream text processing.
9. **Make**: Build automation tool.
10. **Docker CLI**: Managing Docker containers.

---

### **3. Detailed Component Design**

Let's delve into each component to define how we'll implement them.

#### **3.1 Command-Line Interface (CLI)**

- **Language & Runtime:** Use Bun (JavaScript) for scripting.
- **Invocation Pattern:** Users will invoke your program using pipes or commands, e.g.,
  ```bash
  git | ai "commit all untracked files"
  ```

- **Argument Parsing:**
  - Capture the target program (from the pipe or argument).
  - Capture the user's natural language input.

- **Session Handling:**
  - Store session data in temporary files or a designated directory.
  - Generate unique session IDs to differentiate between sessions.

#### **3.2 Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**

- **Using OpenAI API:**
  - Integrate with the OpenAI GPT-4 model via HTTP requests.
  - Use `llamaindex` or a similar library for API interaction.

- **Prompt Design:**
  - Craft prompts that instruct the model to:
    - Understand the user's request.
    - Map it to specific commands.
    - Be aware of the program's version and features.

- **Example Prompt Structure:**
  ```
  You are an AI assistant helping the user interact with [Program Name]. The user said: "[User Input]". Based on the program's version and features, generate a plan to fulfill their request without altering the system state unless confirmed.
  ```

#### **3.3 Context Gathering**

- **Program Detection and Version Retrieval:**
  - Run commands like `[program] --version` to get version info.
  - For example:
    ```bash
    git --version
    ```

- **Environment Analysis:**
  - For `git`, you might run `git status` to understand the repository state.
  - Ensure that commands do not change the system state.

- **Executing Atomic Commands:**
  - Use child processes in Bun to execute commands and capture output.
  - Handle errors if the program is not installed or the command fails.

#### **3.4 Command Planning**

- **Intent Mapping:**
  - The AI model maps the user's intent to specific commands.
  - It should avoid hardcoding and rely on documentation parsing if needed.

- **Plan Generation:**
  - The AI generates a plan with:
    - **Command:** Exact command to run.
    - **Description:** What the command does and expected results.

- **Example Plan:**
  ```json
  [
    {
      "command": "git rm --cached *.tmp",
      "description": "Remove all .tmp files from the index (staging area) but keep them in the working directory."
    },
    {
      "command": "echo '*.tmp' >> .gitignore",
      "description": "Add .tmp files to .gitignore to prevent them from being tracked in the future."
    }
  ]
  ```

#### **3.5 User Interaction Loop**

- **Plan Presentation:**
  - Present the plan in a clear, user-friendly manner.
  - Example:
    ```
    The following steps will be performed:
    1. Remove .tmp files from the Git index but keep them on disk.
       Command: git rm --cached *.tmp
    2. Add .tmp files to .gitignore to ignore them in future commits.
       Command: echo '*.tmp' >> .gitignore

    Do you want to proceed? (Y/N)
    ```

- **Confirmation Handling:**
  - Wait for user input.
  - Proceed if 'Y' is received; otherwise, abort.

#### **3.6 Command Execution**

- **Safe Execution:**
  - Execute commands step by step.
  - Capture standard output and errors.
  - After each command, check for errors before proceeding.

- **Output Handling:**
  - Provide feedback to the user after each command.
  - Example:
    ```
    Executing: git rm --cached *.tmp
    Output: [command output]
    ```

- **Error Handling:**
  - If a command fails, stop execution and inform the user.

#### **3.7 Session Management**

- **State Preservation:**
  - Store conversation history and plan in a session file.
  - Use unique identifiers (e.g., timestamp, hash) for session files.

- **Session Continuation:**
  - Before starting, check for existing session data.
  - If found, load the session and continue where it left off.

- **Session Cleanup:**
  - After successful execution or cancellation, remove session files.

- **Handling Directories:**
  - If the user needs to change directories, inform them and resume after they rerun the command.

#### **3.8 Error Handling and Clarification**

- **Unclear Intent:**
  - If the AI is unsure about the user's request, it can ask a clarifying question.
  - Example:
    ```
    It seems you're trying to merge branches, but no Git repository was found in the current directory. Are you in the correct directory?
    ```

- **Program-Specific Errors:**
  - Handle cases where the target program isn't installed or accessible.
  - Provide helpful messages to guide the user.

---

### **4. Integration with Bun and JavaScript**

- **Why Bun:**
  - Bun provides a modern JavaScript runtime with built-in support for scripting and fast execution.

- **Child Processes in Bun:**
  - Use Bun's APIs to execute shell commands and capture output.

- **HTTP Requests:**
  - Utilize `fetch` or libraries compatible with Bun to make HTTP requests to the OpenAI API.

- **File System Operations:**
  - Use Bun's FS APIs to handle session files and temporary data.

---

### **5. Integrating llamaindex or Similar Library**

- **Purpose:**
  - To facilitate communication with the OpenAI API and manage prompts and responses.

- **Capabilities:**
  - **Tool Calling:** Allows the AI model to suggest or call functions (e.g., execute commands).
  - **Agent Classes:** Can manage conversation context and planning.

- **Customization:**
  - Since you don't need retrieval (knowledge base), you can focus on the agent and tool-calling features.

---

### **6. Security Considerations**

- **Command Validation:**
  - Before executing, validate commands to prevent destructive actions.
  - Implement a safeguard mechanism (e.g., command whitelisting or sandboxing).

- **User Permissions:**
  - Avoid running commands that require elevated privileges (sudo) unless absolutely necessary and with explicit user consent.

- **Input Sanitization:**
  - Sanitize all inputs and handle possible injection attacks.

- **Logging and Transparency:**
  - Log actions taken for audit purposes.
  - Inform the user of all actions before they occur.

---

### **7. Implementation Plan**

Let's break down the implementation into manageable steps.

#### **Step 1: Setup Project Structure**

- Initialize a new Bun project.
- Set up the basic CLI interface.

#### **Step 2: Handle CLI Input**

- Parse command-line arguments to capture the target program and user input.

#### **Step 3: Integrate OpenAI API**

- Set up `llamaindex` or the chosen library.
- Configure API keys and any required settings.
- Test basic request-response cycles with the LLM.

#### **Step 4: Implement Context Gathering**

- Write functions to detect the program's version and environment.
- Ensure commands are executed safely and outputs are captured.

#### **Step 5: Develop NLU and Planning Logic**

- Craft prompts for the AI to generate plans based on user input and context.
- Implement the logic to send prompts and receive structured plans.

#### **Step 6: Present Plan to User**

- Format and output the plan in a user-friendly manner.
- Handle user confirmation input.

#### **Step 7: Execute Commands Safely**

- Upon confirmation, execute each command.
- Capture and display outputs or errors to the user.

#### **Step 8: Implement Session Management**

- Create functions to save and load session data.
- Handle cases where the session needs to be paused and resumed.

#### **Step 9: Error Handling and Clarification**

- Implement logic for the AI to ask clarifying questions.
- Handle scenarios where the user's intent is unclear.

#### **Step 10: Testing**

- Test the application with various scenarios and target programs (e.g., `git`, `ffmpeg`).
- Collect feedback and refine based on issues encountered.

---

### **8. Example Use Cases**

Let's consider an example with `ffmpeg`:

**User Command:**

```bash
ffmpeg | ai "Convert all .mov files in the current directory to .mp4 format with 1080p resolution"
```

**Expected Plan:**

1. **Identify all .mov files in the current directory.**

   - **Command:** `ls *.mov`
   - **Description:** List all .mov files to process.

2. **Convert each .mov file to .mp4 with 1080p resolution.**

   - **Command:** `for file in *.mov; do ffmpeg -i "$file" -s hd1080 "${file%.mov}.mp4"; done`
   - **Description:** Loop through each .mov file and convert it.

**Presentation to User:**

```
The following steps will be performed:
1. List all .mov files in the current directory.
   Command: ls *.mov
2. Convert each .mov file to .mp4 with 1080p resolution.
   Command: for file in *.mov; do ffmpeg -i "$file" -s hd1080 "${file%.mov}.mp4"; done

Do you want to proceed? (Y/N)
```

---

### **9. Moving Forward**

- **Start Coding:**
  - Begin implementing the outlined steps.
  - Focus on getting a basic version working before adding advanced features.

- **Iterative Development:**
  - Implement one feature at a time and test thoroughly.
  - Refine prompts and handling based on testing results.

- **User Feedback:**
  - Once an MVP is ready, test it with actual users to gather feedback.

- **Documentation:**
  - Document code, usage instructions, and contribution guidelines.

---

### **10. Additional Considerations**

- **Extensibility:**
  - Design the system to easily add support for more programs.
  - Consider a plugin-like architecture where specific handlers can be added.

- **Configuration:**
  - Allow users to configure settings, such as API keys, default behaviors, and security preferences.

- **Open Source:**
  - If appropriate, consider open-sourcing the project to encourage community contributions.
